# mq-auto-test
imported from code.google.com/p/mq-auto-test


Small Qt program to run exams written on YAML format

You can configure questions, answer and invalid options on a YAML file.

This program is similar to kid-maths-practice

I hope it will be useful for my kids to study school subjects

This program uses maiquel-toolkit-cpp lib (I also putted it on code google)

maiquel-toolkit-cpp has PCRE, YAML (also available code google)

As at this moment maiquel-toolkit-cpp IDL message compiler generate always code for qpid, it is necesary to compile with libqpidtypes

Program created for my kids
